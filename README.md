### PURPOSE

This lib is used to get hardware info like model, serial, connectivity,
status,... of Motherboard, CPU, RAM, HDD, NIC, v.v..

This lis is not intended to be "beautiful", we don't use a single
methodology to get informations. We will use multi methods to read
information to experimental and practicing.

PS: it could beautify when we feel comfortable and think it necessary.
