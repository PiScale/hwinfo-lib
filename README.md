### PURPOSE

This lib is used to get hardware info like model, serial, connectivity,
status,... of Motherboard, CPU, RAM, HDD, NIC, v.v..

This lib is not intended to be "beautiful", we don't use a single
methodology to get informations. We will use multi methods to read
information to experimental and practicing.

PS: it could be beautified when we feel comfortable and think it's necessary.
